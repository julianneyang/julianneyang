## Hi there 👋

I'm Julianne. I am excited about the potential that bioinformatics holds for transforming the way we
understand and approach research in the life sciences. Biologists are always producing data, generating
large lists of proteins, genes, and microbes of interest. However, transforming these lists into a
comprehensive understanding of critical pathways and processes driving disease has proven to be
extremely challenging. By integrating multiple types of sequencing data, such as whole genome
sequencing, RNA sequencing, and metagenomics sequencing, we can obtain a comprehensive view of the
molecular processes that drive disease. This has great potential for identifying new therapeutic targets and
developing more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases.

- 🔭 I'm currently having an awesome time working on ncRNA sequencing data as a postdoctoral fellow at Merck.
- 💻 I'm best classified as a bioinformatics scientist. Right now, I'm excited about building scalable and reproducible workflows with Nextflow. I'm not that great at it, but I'm a speedy learner! 
- 💩 Previously, I worked on investigating the relationship between genetic risk for disease and the gut microbiome.
- 🌱 I am enthusiastic about expanding my skillset to include other data modalities.
